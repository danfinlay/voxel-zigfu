Presently the API is very simple.  Just pass voxel-zigfu a minecraft-skin of your choice, and voxel-zigfu will take care of the puppeteering the limbs as you move in front of your OpenNI-enabled depth sensor of choice.  Designed for use with [Voxel.js](www.voxeljs.com).  Here it is, tacked on to the end of the minecraft-skin sample code:

	var skin = require('minecraft-skin')
	var viking = skin(THREE, 'viking.png')
	viking.mesh.position.y = 50
	scene.add(viking.mesh)

	var zigfu = require('voxel-zigfu')
	zigfu.puppeteer(viking)
Please note you will need to include the Zigfu source in your HTML page, and you will need their extension installed in your browser.  You can get that at [zigfu.com](http://zigfu.com/).

You can run a demo of the module using browserify and http-server.  First make sure you have them both installed like so:
	npm install browserify -g
	npm install http-server -g
Then you can build the demo site and run it from your terminal:
	browserify demo.js -o bundle.js
	http-server
This will open a port on your localhost that you can open with your browser.
