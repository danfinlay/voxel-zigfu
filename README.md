An experiment to pupeteer a voxel person with an OpenNI/NITE-enabled depth sensor (like the Xbox Kinect).

Right now I'm wrapping my head around the kinematics to make this work right.

I am now aware this problem can be solved using Quaternions, which Three.js has a library to deal with.  I am in the process of digesting and implementing this material now.

A live demo, featuring the right arm active with the current problem is [here](http://danfinlay.com/projects/voxeljs/zigfu/).
